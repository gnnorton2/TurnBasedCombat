Day One- by the end of the first day:
1. sketch out the character class
class Druid(something):
	def __init__(Druid):
		all stats here (name, HP, hitChance/accuracy, maxDamage(points in single hit), armor (positive or negative/cursed))

class deathKnight(something):
	def__init__(deathKnight):
		all stats here

2. indicate all the hidden attributes
Druid
HP: 35, Accuracy: 70, maxDamage: 5, armor: 0

deathKing
HP: 30, Accuracy: 30, maxDamage: 7, armor: 5

3. consider properties for each attribute
@hpHealer, @accuracyChanger, @moreLessDamage @moreLessArmor

4. consider limits for each property (suggested above)
HP: no higher than 35, when in negative that character loses
Accuracy: 20-80
maxDamage: 1-10
armor: -5-5 (negative armor is cursed armor)

5. Write the initializer - consider using named parameters


6. Write least basic (no filter) versions of each property

7. Design and write the printStats() method

8. In main, instantiate a class and print its stats

9. stretch goal - implement filters in properties as needed
